The lib directory has lib440lib.so.  This is an interposition library
that will redirect file operations to RPC calls. It is used just like:
	LD_PRELOAD=lib/lib440lib.so tools/440read foo
	(Use env if you are not running bash).
This will connect to a proxy port specified in proxyport15440
environment variable.  

Note: the protocol between the interposition library and the 
provided code for the proxy uses a shared secret pin to restrict
who is allowed to connect.  You must set the pin15440 environment 
variable to a secret 9-digit number of your choice.

The lib directory also has the RPCreceiver class and its support
interfaces.  This class implements the stubs in Java compatiable with
lib440lib.so.  The proxy code makes use of RPCreceiver to
interface with the clients. 

The doc directory has autogenerated javadoc documentation on
RPCreceiver and related classes. 

To compile the sample, make sure your CLASSPATH environment variable includes the absolute paths
to the lib and sample directories:
	export CLASSPATH=$PWD/lib:$PWD/sample
	(Use setenv if not using bash).
Then cd into the workingdirectory and run make.  

Now we can run the proxy using:
	pin15440=ZZZZZZZZZ proxyport15440=XXXX java Proxy
The pin15440 variable should be the same 9-digit number as above.
