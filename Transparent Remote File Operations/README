To use the interposing library, try (if using BASH shell):
	LD_PRELOAD=./interpose/mylib.so ./tools/440read README
or (if using CSH, TCSH, ...):
	env LD_PRELOAD=./interpose/mylib.so ./tools/440read README

Note that the 440tree tool uses the getdirtree function 
implemented in libdirtree.so in the lib directory.  Please
add the absolute path of this directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
to make sure that the system can find the library, e.g. on BASH:
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;$PWD/lib"
or if using CSH, TCSH, ...:
	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;$PWD/lib"

- Usage: 
by simply running "make" in your working directory, both library and server are built:

cd ./workingdirectory
make
