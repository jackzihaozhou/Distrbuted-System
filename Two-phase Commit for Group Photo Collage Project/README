The main classes (Project4, ProjectLib) and the sample are in the lib 
directory. TheServer and UserNode are provided in the workingdirectory.

To build these, ensure  your CLASSPATH has the absolute paths to the lib and workingdirectory 
included. Then run make in the workingdirectory.  

We have provided some files to start testing your code. 
A set of sample images and test scripts are provided in test.tar.  
To use these, untar the file to produce a test directory with a set
of subdirectories.  Change your woking directory to "test".  
Then, from this directory, run Project4, e.g.:
	java Project4 15440 scripts/1-simple-commits.txt

The Server will run in the Server directory, and up to 4 UserNodes in 
a, b, c, and d.  Ensure that the committed composite images are 
generated in the Server directory, and that the corresponding 
sources are removed from the UserNode directories.  There are
two additional scripts provided as well.
