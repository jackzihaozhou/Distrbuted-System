The main classes (Cloud, ServerLib, Database, ClientSim) and the sample
database file (db1.txt) are in the lib directory.  

Before running, you will need to add the absolute path of workingdirectory and the absolute path of the lib directory to the CLASSPATH
environment variable, e.g., from your working directory:

cd workingdirectory
export CLASSPATH=$PWD:$PWD/../lib

To run the program:

java Cloud <port> <db_file> <rand_spec> <hour> [<duration>]

Here, <port> specifies the port that the Java RMI registry should use. The <db_file> parameter
specifies a text file that will be loaded as the contents of the backend database. A sample file
(db1.txt) is provided in the lib directory. The <hour> parameter is the time of day to be reported
by the simulation (0-24). The optional <duration> parameter indicates the number of seconds to
run the experiment (default=30 seconds).

To run the sample, simply try:
	java Cloud 15440 lib/db1.txt c-2000-1 12

This will launch the "Cloud" service, load the database with the items in 
lib/db1.txt, and start simulating clients arriving at a constant rate every
2000 ms.  A single instance of the sample Server will b erun as a "VM" 
(actually a spearate process).
